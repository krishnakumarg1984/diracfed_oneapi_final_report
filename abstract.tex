\section*{Abstract}\label{sec:abstract}
In preparation for the forthcoming exascale HPC systems which will almost certainly consist of heterogeneous components --- both CPUs and GPUs --- DiRAC has undertaken an exploratory project to document the experiences of porting some representative codes to one or other of two promising programming models: SYCL or OpenMP offload.
The programming models are supported by Intel OneAPI and other commercial and open source compilers.
Five candidate codes (OpenQCD, OpenMM, HemeLB, dGpoly3D, and AREPO) were selected, profiled and kernels were ported.
An absolute performance comparison between programming models was not a goal of this initial work.
We report the experience of a group of research software engineers, most of whom were novices in SYCL or OpenMP GPU offload programming.
